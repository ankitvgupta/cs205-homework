1) 255 seconds. 255 comparisons need to be made.
2) 128 seconds. Again, a total of 255 comparions need to be made, so ideally they will partition the bags into two halfs, and each will make 127 comparisons. Then, they will need to add their sums together, which will be the 128th.
3) Since a single person can add the sum of at most 2 bags in a time step, that means that in the first time step, the most comparisons that can be made 128. Likewise, in the second, it will be 64, and so on. So, the number of seconds it will take is log_2(256) which is 8.
4) It would be the ceiling of log_2(N).
5) Basically, we get the same approach as before, except that all steps after the first one take two seconds instead of just one, just we now have to communicate. Since it previously took 8 steps, now 7 of those will take an extra second. Note that this works since you would still split the work until there are only 2 bags per cashier, because if there were 4 bags, it would take 3 seconds for one person to calculate it, but only 2 seconds for two people. So, we would still maintain the same distribution of 128 cashiers in time step 1, 64 in step 2, etc. So the total is 8 + 7 = 15 seconds.
6) First, let's assume that we need to distribute the bags before any calculations happen. In this case, it takes 256 seconds to distribute bags to 256 unique cashiers, and another second for half of them to give their bags to a second person so that he can combine them. At this point, we have reduced it to problem (5), and it will take 15 more sceonds. Thus, the total time is 272 (256 + 1 +  15).
If you can pass out 2 bags at a time, then the first step will take 128 seconds, and then there will be 15 additional seconds after that, for a total of 143.
If there are no limits on how many at a time, you should first give all of your bags to one cashier, who will then recurisvely pass half of his bags to another cashier. This process will take 9 seconds to reach 2 bags per cashier. Then, it will take 15 seconds to sum there, for a total of 24.
